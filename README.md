## Conclusion

The model was significanlty improved by using Data augmentation technique which is increasing the amount of data available for training by generating new training examples from existing ones and applying some transformations.

I tested multiple architectures and one of the best performance was achived with the model shown here.

Ð¢hanks to the Train-Validation-Test split, I was able to evaluate the model, because test data set was without notation. 

By picking 25 random images from the test set, it can be observed that 24 of them were accurately predicted.
